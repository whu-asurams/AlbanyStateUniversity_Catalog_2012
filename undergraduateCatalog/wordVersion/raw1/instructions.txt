Instructions for editing the document:

   0. The general guideline for editing the document is not to use the "Page Layout" entry 
       of the menu bar, nor to insert page header/footer. 

   1. Each page of the document is one section, which allows it to have different page layout. 
       Please do not change that setting. Otherwise, wild results may occur.

   2. When editing one page, and the content is short, please leave it as it is.

   3. When editing one page, and the content is more than page, please keep going 
       with what Word provides and ignore anything on the margin area.

   4. The document tracks editings. In other words, deleted words will still be displayed 
       but with a strike through mark.  

   5. If space allowed, you can also add one picture.

   6. At the end of the document, there are blank pages attached, which can be used to 
       add new contents. Or you can just leave them blank.
