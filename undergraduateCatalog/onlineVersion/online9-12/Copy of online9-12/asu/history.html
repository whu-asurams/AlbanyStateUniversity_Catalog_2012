<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts10><br></span></p>
<p   class=rvps4><span   class=rvts11>Albany   State   University,   established
originally  as  the  Albany Bible and Manual Training Institute and supported by
private  and  religious  organizations,  was  founded in 1903 by Joseph Winthrop
Holley.  The  Institute  provided  religious  and  manual  training  for African
American  youths  of  Southwest  Georgia.  The  mission was to train teachers to
teach  basic  academic  skills  and  to train in the trades and industries, with
special  emphasis  on  domestic  science  and  art.  The  Institute  remained  a
privately supported Institution until 1917.</span></p> 
<p class=rvps5><span class=rvts11><br></span></p>
<p    class=rvps6><span   class=rvts11>In   1917,   the   Institute   became   a
state-supported,  two-year  college  with  a Board of Trustees, and its name was
changed  to  Georgia  Normal  and  Agricultural College. Offering only a limited
program  in  agriculture, the College viewed as its primary purpose the training
of  elementary  teachers. In 1932, the Board of Regents was established, and the
college   became   a   part  of  the  newly  established  University  System  of
Georgia.</span></p> 
<p class=rvps7><span class=rvts11><br></span></p>
<p  class=rvps8><span  class=rvts11>In  order  to  meet  the  changing  needs of
society,  the  mission  of the College was expanded in 1943, and the College was
granted  four-year  status  and  authorized  to  confer the bachelor</span><span
class=rvts12>’</span><span  class=rvts11>s  degree in elementary education and
home  economics.  At  this  time,  the  College  assumed  the  name Albany State
College.  Six  years  later,  the  program  of the College was again expanded to
include  offerings  in  the arts and sciences, with majors in the humanities and
social studies.</span></p> 
<p class=rvps9><span class=rvts11><br></span></p>
<p  class=rvps10><span  class=rvts11>Beginning in 1954, secondary-level programs
were   developed  for  teacher  preparation  in  science,  health  and  physical
education,  business,  music,  mathematics  and  natural  sciences.  The College
continued  to  experience  growth  and development and was authorized in 1961 to
offer a four-year degree program in nursing.</span></p> 
<p class=rvps11><span class=rvts11><br></span></p>
<p  class=rvps12><span  class=rvts11>Always  striving to address the educational
needs  of  the  time,  the  graduate  program, a cooperative effort with Georgia
State  University,  was  added  to the curriculum during the fall of 1972. Under
this  program,  master</span><span  class=rvts12>’</span><span  class=rvts11>s
degrees  were  offered  in business education, mathematics education, elementary
education,  English  education,  health  and physical education, music education
and  science  education (biology, chemistry and physics). In the spring of 1975,
a   master</span><span  class=rvts12>’</span><span  class=rvts11>s  degree  in
business  administration,  through  Valdosta  State  College,  was  added to the
graduate program.</span></p> 
<p class=rvps13><span class=rvts11><br></span></p>
<p   class=rvps14><span  class=rvts11>During  the  decade  of  the  </span><span
class=rvts12>’</span><span  class=rvts11>70s,  the  number  of faculty earning
the  doctorate  degree  increased  by  more than fifty percent, and in September
1981,  the  College  began  offering  a  graduate program designed and delivered
solely  by  faculty  and  staff  of  Albany  State  College.  Master</span><span
class=rvts12>’</span><span  class=rvts11>s  degrees in business administration
and  education  were  offered.  Since  then criminal justice, nursing and public
administration have been added.</span></p> 
<p class=rvps15><span class=rvts11><br></span></p>
<p  class=rvps16><span  class=rvts11>Albany State College was granted university
status  in  July  1996,  and  the  name of the Institution was changed to Albany
State  University. During this impressive growth and development, the University
has been guided by the following presidents:</span></p>
