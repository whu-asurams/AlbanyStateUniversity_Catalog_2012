# AlbanyStateUniversity_Catalog_2012

I was the editor of the first online catalogs (Undergraduate and Gradaute) of Albany State University, which was online in 2012. I was also the editor of the Word version catalogs at that time. Current online catalogs of 
Albany State University were based on mine.

There have been a lot of changes since then, which include the styles, the contents and additional features.
